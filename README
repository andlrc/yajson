SIMPLE JSON VALIDATOR WRITTEN WITH LEX/YACC
-------------------------------------------

This is a very simple example showing how to write a parser with LEX and YACC.
This is made who is interested in knowing how this works, but thinks the
intermediate entry level is to steep.

- ``yajson.c'' contains ``main'' and calls ``yyparse'' which kicks in the
  parsing.
- ``yajson.lx.l'' is LEX grammar.
- ``yajson.g.y'' is the YACC grammar.
